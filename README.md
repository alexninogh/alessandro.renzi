# Personal site of Alessandro Renzi

I am a researcher in cosmology at the [University of Padova](https://www.unipd.it/en/contatti/rubrica?detail=Y&ruolo=1&checkout=cerca&persona=renzi&key=5F749F2E49E4888AE8B2F471823535B3) (UniPD) and National Institute of Nuclear Physics - [INFN](https://baltig.infn.it/alexnino/alessandro.renzi). My work is at the crossroads of Cosmology, High Performance Computing, Data Analysis and Signal Processing.

I can program in Julia, Fortran, C, Python, C++ (listed in order of enjoyment when coding :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:).
